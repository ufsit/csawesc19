In this qualifier we used GHIDRA to reverse engineer an unknown binary file to understand how to provide the correct flag and discover any other interesting features. We recovered the correct flag of ``21212121'' and noticed the false, hidden flag of ``shhimhiding''. With the necessary background in reverse engineering we are prepared to tackle the firmware analysis and exploitation of the RFID platform.
