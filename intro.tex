To begin our analysis of the given \texttt{qualification.out} object, we start by running the GNU \texttt{file} command on it.
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left,language=none]
qualification.out: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, ... , not stripped
\end{lstlisting}
Immediately we know that this is an x86-64 ELF binary executable, which is unstripped, meaning functions should have names.
Next running \texttt{strings} on the binary (``...'' means snipped text) we see:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left,language=none]
...
Great Job! The flag is what you entered
The flag is <<shhimhiding>>
;*3$"
GCC: (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.4) 4.8.4
...
qualification.cpp
...
_Z14secretFunctionv
...
_Z17challengeFunctionPc
\end{lstlisting}
From the strings, we see a ``good flag'' message, an actual flag, that this binary was written as C++, and two C++ mangled functions.

With initial static analysis out of the way, we can set the file as executable and do some dynamic analysis.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=none]
$ chmod +x qualification.out
$ ./qualification.out
$ ./qualification.out test
$ ./qualification.out shhimhiding
\end{lstlisting}

Running the binary with and without arguments (even the flag found via strings) yields no ``goodboy'' message. To investigate further, we start GHIDRA 9.0 to begin our analysis.
We create a new GHIDRA project and load the binary into it. We open the CodeBrowser tool and perform auto-analysis.
