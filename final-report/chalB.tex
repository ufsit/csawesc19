This challenge involved a simple algorithm that, based on the values of an array through which it iterated, would select characters from a lookup table (LUT) containing the ASCII alphabet. The most important code is the following: 
\begin{lstlisting}
lut_it = 0;
hash_it = 7;
for(int i = 1; i < 0x1e; i++){
	if (done == 0) {
		if (indexes[i] == indexes[i - 1]) {
			lut_it = lut_it + 1;
		}
		else {
			if ((indexes[i] == 0) || (indexes[i - 1] == 0)) {
				if (indexes[i - 1] != 0) {
					challHashGen[hash_it] = LUT[lut_it + indexes[i - 1] * 3];
					hash_it = hash_it + 1;
				}
				lut_it = 0;
			}
			else {
				done = 1;
			}
		}
	}
}

\end{lstlisting}
In order to select the nth character from the LUT, \texttt{lut\_it} should be $n\%3$ and indexes[i-1] should be $n/3$. To achieve this, we set an array with $n\%3+1$ instances of the value $n/3$, followed by a single zero. This pattern was repeated for each character that was needed to achieve the correct output message.
